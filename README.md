# simpleVectorGraphicsv2
Hello, this is an extended version of previously published simpleVectorGraphics project.
Decorator framework is applied to control the behaviour of bounding boxes.
I also added a SingletonObject mixin, which prevents all objects of SingletonItem type from appearing more than once on the screen at the same time.
